Task duration:  25 minutes

`Requirements:`
In this task, you are given an index.html file, app.js file, and a CSS stylesheet called styles.css.  The index.html file will display a simple button using a <div> tag styled as a button. You will follow the steps below to retrieve the current date/time when the button is clicked. Hint: You can use JavaScript's built in `Date()` function to get the current date/time.


`Steps:`
1. Register an event listener to listen for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM fully loads before executing any code.

2. Add an event listener to the <div> button so that when clicked the button will populate the <p> tag with the current date and time.

`Bonus:`
Dynamically build a <h1> heading and programmatically add your name to the page when the DOM is fully loaded.
