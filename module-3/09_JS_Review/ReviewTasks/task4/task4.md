Task duration:  25 minutes

`Requirements:`
In this task, you are given an index.html file, app.js file, and a CSS stylesheet called styles.css.  The index.html file will display a simple button using a <div> tag styled as a button. 


`Steps:`
1. Register an event listener to listen for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM fully loads before executing any code.

2. Add an event listener to the <div> button so that when you click the button the body background color will turn beige by applying the `.color_2` class.

3. Add an event listener to the <div> button so that when you double-click the button the body background color will turn cornflower blue by applying the `color_3` class.
