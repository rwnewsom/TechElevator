Task duration:  15 minutes

`Requirements:`
In this task, you are given an app.js file with an array of home objects defined for you. Write a named function called `basic_zip_filter` that takes a parameter called `zipCode`. Then use the array filter() method to return only the homes that match the parameter value (a valid zip code) that is passed in. 

After you write the function, call your `basic_zip_filter` function passing it a valid zip code and then print out the new array of homes that is returned from your function (it is OK to just print the JavaScript objects)

`Running you code`
Test/Run your code via git_bash using `node app.js`


`IMPORTANT!`
After completing this task, check in your code to BitBucket using the git commit message 'task 2 complete' if completed, or 'task 2 incomplete' if you are unable to complete the task.
