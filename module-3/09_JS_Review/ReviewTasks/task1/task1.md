Task duration:  15 minutes

`Requirements:`
In this task, you are given an app.js file with an array of home objects defined for you. Write a named function called `basic_forEach` that loops through the given array and prints out the MLS Id, zip code and price. Loop through the array using the forEach() method. 

`Bonus:` 
Write a named function called `standard_for_loop` that does the same thing but uses the basic javascript `for loop` syntax instead. (not the array method).


`Running you code`
Test/Run your code via git_bash using `node app.js`

`IMPORTANT!`
After completing this task, check in your code to BitBucket using the git commit message 'task 1 complete' if completed, or 'task 1 incomplete' if you are unable to complete the task.
