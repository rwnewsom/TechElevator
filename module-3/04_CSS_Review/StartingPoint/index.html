            <p>How fun could facts about rabbits possibly be?</p>

                <li>Rabbits are literally made out of pillows</li>
                <li>Rabbits are so fast that they are commonly used to generate new unique identifiers for SQL Server databases</li>
                <li>Rabbits refuse to write APIs, citing REST as a potential allergy</li>
                <li>Rabbits do not enjoy it when dogs chase after them</li>
                <li>Rabbits could be considered an attempt to weaponize cuteness</li>

            <h2>Rabbits in Popular Culture</h2>
            <p>Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny. The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the Velveteen Rabbit, or Thumper in Bambi).</p>
            <p>With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy Bunny. The rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icons the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.</p>

            <h2>Rabbits in Unpopular Culture</h2>
            <p>
                It's hard to tell where rabbits fit into unpopular culture because said culture is, by its very nature, unpopular and instructors are too lazy to bother Googling things when looking for raw content on HTML.

            <h2>Opinion: Rabbits are Evil</h2>
            <cite>By Jester the Cairn Terrier</cite>
            <img src="images/RabbitsAreEvil.png" />
            <p>Listen up, this is very important: <em>Bun-buns are evil.</em></p>
            <p>There. I said it. Sure, they cute and fluffy, but they get in your yard and eat up all your grass. They look like they want to play, but when you try to chase them, they run and hide.</p>
            <p>Bun buns are just flat out jerks. It not fair that they eating my grass or looking so snuggly but not want to play with the Jester.</p>
            <p>If bun buns weren't up to no good, they'd have no problem with the Jester grabbing them and shaking them, or at least maybe just nibbing on their toes.</p>
            <p>Trust me; Bun buns are up to no good.</p>
