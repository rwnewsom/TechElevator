                <h2>Our Goals</h2>

                <h3>Primary Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Since July of 2020, our primary goal has been to equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge -
                    and the ability to communicate those things - so that you may <b>get hired</b> and become
                    productive and healthy members of the technical community.
                </p>
                <h3>Secondary Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Our secondary goal has been to equip you to play a key part in the revolution when .NET rises up and
                    takes back our rightful place of prominence in the technical community. For too long we have endured
                    the scorn of PHP developers... Wait, I've just been handed
                    a note. Apparently our secondary goal is on hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alright then, I guess we just want to help you land that first job and feel awesome about yourselves so
                    you go on to build great things. That's still pretty cool, but maybe you could look into the thing with
                    the PHP developers? They can be kind of annoying.

                <h2>A Note to Visitors</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're viewing this site and wondering <i>Is this for real?</i>, the answer is likely <i>No</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site was built as a lecture example for students of
                    <a href="https://www.TechElevator.com?ref=SallyTheSquirrel">
                        Tech Elevator's 14 week programming bootcamp
                    </a>
                    to learn more about building web applications by walking them through the construction of
                    this site. The squirrel theme was chosen to be humorous and the interview question subject matter was
                    chosen to help the students reinforce knowledge from prior weeks as they headed into interviewing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're curious, our students go through four modules of curriculum:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>C# Development</li>
                    <li>SQL Development</li>
                    <li>ASP .NET Core Development</li>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, JS, and Vue.js</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This web application is a teaching exercise related to that final module.
