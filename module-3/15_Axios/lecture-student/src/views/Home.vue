                <p>Welcome to <strong>Sally the Squirrel's One-Stop Interview Question Shop!</strong></p>

                <p>This site was created as a way of teaching a bunch of future programmers from Tech Elevator how to
                    develop applications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.</p>

                <p>These folks are pretty awesome, and the subject matter of this site also gives them a way of polishing up
                    on technical interview questions related to C#, SQL, and web technologies.
