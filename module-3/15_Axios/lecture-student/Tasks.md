Product Owner / Team Lead Gripes:

- [ ] Bug Details should use the same types of status and priority badges that the list does
- [ ] Bug Details just looks underwhelming in general. Maybe bootstrap cards or something else?
- [ ] Poor contrast when hovering over a link on a table row. What about bootstrap tables?
- [ ] Table Rows should really be their own components if they're going to grow in complexity
