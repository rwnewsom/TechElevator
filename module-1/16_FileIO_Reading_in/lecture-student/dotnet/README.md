# File I/O Part 1 Exercises (Pair)

## Word Count

Write a program that asks for a filesystem path for a text file and reads the contents of the file. After processing the file, it displays both the number of words and the number of sentences in the file.

Hints: 
- Words are delimited by space characters.
- Sentences are terminated by either a period, an exclamation mark, or a question mark.

Use `alices_adventures_in_wonderland.txt` for test input.

The output should be:
```
Word Count: 30355
Sentence Count: 1116*
```
**Sentence Count may vary between 1116 - 1839.*
